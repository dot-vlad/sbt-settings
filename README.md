# _sbt_ plugin for common _sbt_ settings [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/drivergroup/sbt-settings.svg?token=***REMOVED***&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/drivergroup/sbt-settings)
Provides common Driver Scala projects configuration for sbt, Scala compiler, testing, linting, formatting, release process, packaging, publication. Allows to use only necessary parts. Sets artifact `organization` to `xyz.driver`.

## TL;DR

### project/plugins.sbt

    resolvers += "releases" at "https://drivergrp.jfrog.io/drivergrp/releases"
    credentials += Credentials("Artifactory Realm", "drivergrp.jfrog.io", "sbt-publisher", "***REMOVED***")

    addSbtPlugin("xyz.driver" % "sbt-settings" % "0.7.34")

### build.sbt

There are two different ways to use `sbt-settings` configuration:

  * As a "Service" — deployed application distributed as a Docker container. Includes Driver Inc.'s artifactory settings, Docker packaging with truststore configuration, build info generation. Versioned using `version.sbt` file for major and minor versions. Usage example, as follows

	```
	lazy val root = (project in file("."))
	  .driverService ("Name-Of-Your-Service")

	  .integrationTestingConfiguration // Enable integration tests

	  .packagingConfiguration          // To package to zip file as java server app

	  .settings(lintingSettings)       // Scala code linting settings, includes `wartRemoverSettings` and `scalastyleSettings`

	  .settings(formatSettings)        // Standard Scala code formatting

	  .settings(releaseSettings(ServiceReleaseProcess)) // Release process configuration
	```

  * As a "Library" — commonly used code, distributed as jar using artifactory. Versioned  using git tag-based versioning. Includes Driver Inc.'s artifactory settings, publication to artifactory, `sbt release` settings,

  	```
  	lazy val root = (project in file("."))
     .driverLibrary("Name-Of-Your-Library")
     .settings(lintingSettings ++ formatSettings)
   ```

Do `sbt reload` after adding a plugin and changing project configuration.


## Reference

Artifact organization is set to `xyz.driver`.
